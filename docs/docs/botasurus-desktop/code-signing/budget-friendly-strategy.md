# Budget Friendly Strategy for Early Stage Developers

## Code signing is quite expensive. Is there a cost-effective alternative for an early-stage developer?

Yes, it is expensive ($99â€“$1,068 per year), and for early-stage developers, it is financially unwise to invest in a certificate when your app has no users yet.

If you are just starting out, here's how you can launch with **0 code-signing costs**:

1. **Temporarily adjust your app download page:**  
   - **For macOS:** Do not provide a download link. Installation is impossible without changing settings that most macOS users do not know how to change.  
   - **For Windows:** Provide the download link and include a message such as:  
     > "Temporarily, you will see a blue popup from Windows Defender stating that the app is from an **unknown publisher**. This is because we are not yet a verified publisher. Rest assured, the app is 100% safe. To proceed, click 'More Info' and then 'Run Anyway.' We aim to become a verified publisher soon to resolve this."
2. Focus on promoting your app and building a user base.  
3. Monetize once you have enough users.  
4. After a few months, when your app generates revenue, invest in code signing certificates for macOS and Windows.

## Why is this financially wise?

This approach lets you start with 0 code-signing costs and invest only after your app generates revenue.

Once again, **do not invest in code signing** if you are just starting out and are **short on cash**. Windows users can still install an unsigned app, giving you a large enough user base to monetize your product.
