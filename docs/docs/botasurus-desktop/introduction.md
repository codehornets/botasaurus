**Build Production Ready Desktop Scrapers in 1 Day**

:::


### What is a Desktop Extractor?
A **Desktop Extractor** is a standalone application that runs locally on your computer to extract data from websites, PDFs, Excel files, and other documents. Unlike web-based tools, it operates offline, offering:  
- **Faster performance** (no cloud latency)  
- **Zero cloud costs** (runs on your machine)

### Why Do Desktop Scrapers Outperform Web-Based Scrapers?
A web-based scraper sends your work to someone else's server farm; a Desktop Extractor keeps the entire workflow on your laptop. That one shift leads to the following big wins:

**1. Zero Cloud Bills**: 
   - Runs on the user's machine, eliminating expensive cloud computing fees  
   - Charge less than competitors while keeping 100% margins  

**2. Faster Execution**:  
   - No waiting for cloud VMs to spin up  
   - User's 4-core CPU beats shared cloud servers  

**3. Higher User Engagement**:  
   The app sits right on the user's desktop, encouraging frequent use compared to web tools they must actively visit via browser.  

**4. Cross-Platform Deployment in 1 Day**:  
    With **Botasaurus**, you can create a production-ready desktop scraper for **Windows (.exe), macOS (.dmg), and Linux (.deb/.rpm)** within 1 day. No need to build a website, manage servers, or handle scaling issues. Bota Desktop includes built-in features such as:

    - Task management
    - Data table
    - Data export (Excel, CSV, etc.)
    - Sorting & filtering
    - Caching
    - Auto updates and many more

With zero cloud costs, faster performance, and easier development, Desktop Scrapers simply offer a better cost/performance envelope than the cloud.

### But I Don't Know Electron/React/Databases!
Here's the magic:  

✅ **You write scraping logic** (simple JavaScript/TypeScript)  
✅ **Botasaurus handles the rest**: Task scheduling, data export, caching, sorting and filtering, installers, auto updates, etc.  

**Example**: A stock price scraper needs just 3 steps:  
1. Write a 10-line function to scrape Yahoo Finance  
2. Add input controls (1 file)  
3. Click "npm run package" – your app is ready
